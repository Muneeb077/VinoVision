With a cross-validation score of 45.40% and a bottom-line accuracy of 45.86%, the original logistic regression model was trained on all features. Subsequent use of different feature selection and data transformation methods showed appreciable increases in prediction accuracy. The feature selection method that eliminated the terms "alcohol," "free sulphur dioxide," and "total sulphur dioxide" yielded a significant improvement, attaining an astounding accuracy rate of 95.51%. This comparison shows how important it is to choose features carefully in order to improve the model's performance after it has been started.

The Box-Cox transformation on "total sulphur dioxide" produced the best accuracy of all the transformation techniques used, coming in at 85.15%. This performed better than other transformations, like the log transformation on "residual sugar" (68.99%) and "free sulphur dioxide" (68.21%). It's interesting to note that the "total sulphur dioxide" log transformation showed the biggest improvement, highlighting the variation in the effects of various transformations on various variables. This internal comparison highlights how critical it is to customize transformation decisions according to the unique properties and distributions of individual features.

When comparing feature selection strategies, the largest accuracy increase (95.51%) was obtained by removing the terms "alcohol," "free sulphur dioxide," and "total sulphur dioxide." On the other hand, alternative feature selection strategies, like eliminating the terms "fixed acidity," "alcohol," and "pH," showed a drop in accuracy to 57.08%. This internal assessment highlights the need of carefully weighing each feature's relevance to the predictive task and the nuanced effects of each feature selection strategy. It also emphasizes the need to make a wise decision because not all feature selection techniques result in advancements.

When comparing the effects of transformations with feature selection, it becomes clear that some transformations, like the log transformation on "residual sugar" and the Box-Cox transformation on "total sulphur dioxide," each independently produced significant accuracy gains. Nevertheless, the feature selection approach that eliminated "alcohol," "free sulphur dioxide," and "total sulphur dioxide" produced the greatest accuracy improvement. This comparison indicates that feature selection is still a powerful method for enhancing overall model performance by highlighting the significance of particular variables in the prediction task, even though transformations can improve the representational power of individual features. Combining the two approaches could offer a thorough method for improving predictive models depending on the special qualities of the dataset.
